@everyone 

This is not a CP challenge. 

The task is simple, print/show “Eid Mubarak” using any programming language. You can just use printf to do this. But i want creativity. You can print it using assembly, you can plot in python which shows Eid Mubarak, you can make a game that shows the text when the level is finished, you can write Eid Mubarak within the code itself. Do whatever you want, I will judge based on creativity and your code.

After you’re done, screen record you running the code and upload it to drive/youtube with public access and fillup this form using that: https://forms.gle/3xMsNnLzM22ugxrX7


You can only fillup the form once, the form will be closed at 1:30AM. 

After 1:30AM, I will share the submissions here so that everyone can see. They can also share their opinions about who did the best job.

Please don’t use any AI, use your own creativity. Don’t communicate with anyone while the challenge is running. Anyone from 20-23 can participate, other series can participate unofficially. Top 5 will get eid salami from me.
